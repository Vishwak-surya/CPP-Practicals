# Basic C++ Operations

This program lets you do some simple math and number tricks in C++.

## How to Run

1.  **Save the code:** Save the C++ code you have as `main.cpp`.
2.  **Open a terminal:** If you're on Windows, open Command Prompt or PowerShell. If you're on macOS or Linux, open Terminal.
3.  **Go to the folder:** Use the `cd` command to go to the folder where you saved `main.cpp`. For example, if it's in your Downloads folder, you might type `cd Downloads` and press Enter.
4.  **Compile the code:** Type `g++ main.cpp -o program` and press Enter.
5.  **Run the program:** Type `./program` and press Enter.
6.  **Follow the menu:** The program will show you a list of things you can do. Type the number for what you want to do and press Enter.
7.  **Give it numbers:** The program might ask you to type in some numbers. Do that and press Enter.
8.  **See the results:** The program will show you the answer.
9.  **To stop:** Type `17` and press Enter.

## What it Can Do

* Check if a number is odd or even.
* See if a number is positive, negative, or zero.
